# Commercify

## Description

*E-Commerce Backend*

Seeing as how e-commerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry, I decided to create this app. This project is meant to simulate an E-Commerce site's backend. This application uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Learning Points

Having been my first exposure to routes, this project has taught me many things. The greatest learning point is being able to connect parts of code using routes in order to improve readability of larger code bases.
